Description:
------------

WeatherForecast provides a weather forecast (who'd have thought? ;) ) based on
forecast.io data. 

Requirements:
-------------
- VDR 1.7.x     
- libcurl
- jansson

Installation, configuration:
----------------------------

To download the plugin from the GIT repository, do a

git clone git://projects.vdr-developer.org/vdr-plugin-weatherforecast.git

Install the plugin depending on your used distribution.

The plugin has no startup parameters. During first startup of the plugin
(and everytime the VDR setup parameter "weatherforecast.city" is empty) 
automatically an online lookup is done to detect your location (city, longitude,
latitude) by your used public ip. The latitude and longitude results are used 
by the plugin to fetch appropriate data from forecast.io. The city is just
used for displaying purposes.

Since weatherforecast.io allows only 1000 API calls per day for free, the results 
from forecast.io are cached up to 20h in 

<PLUGINCACHEDIR>/weatherforecast/weather.json

If this file does not exist on Plugin startup, a new online lookup is done anyway.

city, longitude and latitude are stored and can be adapted manually in the plugin
setup menu. f you change latitude or longitude, just delete the cached
weather.json file and restart VDR to achieve new data for the newly configured
location.

You can configure your own API Key in Plugin Setup. If an own API Key is configured,
you're allowed to change the update frequency from forecast.io individually, update
frequency can then be a value between 1 and 24h.

Usage:
------

The plugin provides three different menus: "current weather", "next 48 hours" 
and "next 7 days". Additionally the plugin provides a service interface so that
skins and other plugins are able to achieve weather data from the plugin.

Even if the plugin runs with every skin, best results can be reached by using a
skindesigner skin which implements the weather plugin templates.
